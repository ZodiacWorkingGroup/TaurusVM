# ZFG File Format
The ZFG ("Zee Eff Gee" or "Zonfig") file format is an advanced variant of the CFG file format based on Python, Java, and other real programming languages.

## Syntax
A line in ZFG follows this syntax: `<key>:<value>`. `key` is a constant that means something to the program that the  ZFG configures, whereas `value` is the thing the user changes. Whitespace is ignored. Key order is usually not relevant.
